# Good Cyber security starts with good habits

September 2020.

I think about habits a lot. Specifically, how the systems I put in place in my life and work will ensure that I meet my goals. Making a habit part of your identity is a powerful way of securing positive change that persists beyond the completion of a goal. I recommend James Clear’s book  [Atomic Habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits)  for a deep dive into this topic.
Working for a high-growth start-up can put your habit-forming resolve to the test. Since university, I’ve always trained - running, swimming, or cycling and for a time, being a triathlete was a core part of my identity. Then, during a hectic period of growth at Auth0 in 2018, I let it all slip. I stopped doing what I had always done and was left overweight and unhealthy.

When I decided it was time to turn this around, I knew eventually I would like to race again, but it was more important to establish the habitual routine of swim/bike/run to ensure that my health wouldn’t again suffer under stress. This meant making training a regular part of my routine once more. My fitness progressed slowly across 2019 under this regimen, and I decided to enter a race to test myself. The pandemic unfolded and racing was canceled I was left goalless - but I’m pleased to say I didn’t regress. Those habits have stuck. And, they’ve helped me manage the various stresses of the current climate and the demands of leading a large team who are struggling through this intense time.

Establishing strong core habits is my philosophy for running a Security organization too. For the operational aspects, you need to embed healthy habits that drive care and attention to the basics. (You may also hear good operational practice referred to as “good hygiene,” but I hope to replace that strange phrase with “good habits” to make people feel less creeped out when we discuss security basics).

The best security programs care about patching, access control, awareness, and visibility. These are the areas that are still most likely to catch you out and lead to compromise. They are the processes that need to be a part of your team’s ethos: the things they just do.

This focus on the basics can lead many security professionals to say that nothing has changed - that, they’re still doing the same stuff they were 20 years ago, and, I may have also been guilty of such glib statements in the past. But it’s not true: we have moved from physical data centers and servers to virtualization, some of us to the Cloud. We now have Infrastructure as Code, and container models with homogeneous and continuous deployments. Some of the security primitives we use to secure these systems are the same but a lot has changed nevertheless.
Habits aren’t just personal - we share habits at a macro level that are shaped by society. And, these too given enough time will change.

I previously wrote about the  [Death of the Corporate network](https://auth0.com/blog/the-death-of-the-corporate-network/)  and the move to remote work is an example of habitual change on a societal level. It existed before the pandemic, but the change has accelerated, and it’s now likely that many people just won’t go back to work in an office. For Security teams, this has upended our defensive models and broken detection methods. We likely could have seen this coming and planned for an orderly transition, trying to avoid the scramble to launch remote IT overnight. Also, as people adjust to being at home, it’s likely other behaviors will change, perhaps more personal multitasking from work devices or even just using their own devices to access your infrastructure.

Other cultural habits will change, accelerated by the pandemic, climate change, or an aging workforce and population. We need to “ [sensitize ourselves to new habits and their cascading indirect effects](https://hbr.org/2020/09/adapt-your-business-to-the-new-reality) ”, a reaction and readjustment is required. And as the change steps up, so too must the rate at which we evolve our approaches.

It’s the job of Security leaders to establish good habits for their teams. And, it’s also our job to track the changing habits of the user communities we secure. We should try to nudge them towards good choices where we can, and ultimately secure the new world we are presented with.
