# Connecting with the Product

June 2022.

I strongly believe that if a Cyber Security professional can buy into the mission of their company and connect with the Product they’re securing, then the sense of shared mission is a powerful way to reduce burnout and increase longevity.

Often Cyber security folks have told me that they want to work at a place with an interesting threat model. I have a clear memory of a CISO saying his life at a high-end consumer goods company was boring. “Who was ever going to attack them?” he said. In his view, they didn’t have an interesting profile; nothing interesting happened there, no one is trying to hack them.

This does make sense; Cyber Security is unique within technology roles as we are dealing with real adversaries. Therefore having a richer group of threat actors should stimulate more interesting cyber defense work. But, an “interesting threat model” also feels like a euphemism for “will spend a lot of money on security” i.e., a company that has advanced threats will actually “get security” which really I’m using as a euphemism for “will spend a lot of money on security.”

I think there is a better way. In this past decade, I’ve taken satisfaction from securing and supporting a Product, understanding the company mission, and putting the Security Organization at the center of it.

Where “connecting with the product” can drive a sense of long-term sustained satisfaction is through recognizing that the day-to-day work of a security team is often intangible. We react, manage ambiguity, and lead through disruption. We deal with the unexpected and help the business recover. That’s not always satisfying! Some of the burn-out in security teams is from the never ending nature of this mission.

Usually, companies have a rhythm. Be that: quarterly goals, product launches or an annual revenue goal. There is likely something yearly that the business is pushing towards. Even if you’re not directly contributing, indirectly you are. You’re securing these goals and derisking them. This rhythm comes with natural breaks and points to celebrate - hello presidents club. We can be thinking about: how do we get this to market on the timeline as safely as possible? How do we add pressure release valves into the product development cycle that stops too much risk from accruing during key periods? Where can we shift resources from to support that next big product launch?

We are desperately looking for solutions to burnout in Cyber Security. I’m not saying that buying-in alone will fully address this, but I do think that a subtle shift in how we think about what we do will help. Firstly by embracing collaboration and a shared identity as we work with other teams to secure the product. And, secondly a shift away from the anxiety of “threat culture” where there is less of a focus on existential threats day-to-day when building security. Keep that for your threat modeling.
